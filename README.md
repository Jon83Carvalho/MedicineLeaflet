# MedicineLeaflet

An App that serves as an AI agent for medicine leaflet

The MedLeaFlet gets public official information about medicines leaflet and allows the user to make questions such as "what is recommended use?", "What is the emergency contact?" , "What are the side effects?" and provide a very comprehensive answer. The Gemini is used in 2 moments: 1 - If you type any word in the drug search field Gemini indetifies what possible name the user is searching and propose 2 alternatives if the original word hasn't resulted in a list of values; 2 - After the drug is selected the Gemini process the question and the information of the official leaflet and provides an answer, making sure to mark if the drug is applied to humans and if there is reference to children usage. This basically help elderly or others that need fast information and may be confused by the amount of information in the Leaflet.
